# JBoss Community Outreach Programs

JBoss community regularly participates in community outreach programs. We use this Github organization to track student/intern/contributor work.

We have our archived work of projects during old community outreach programs stored at https://github.com/JBossOutreachArchive.

For specific information about some of the programs, please check out the following repositories.
